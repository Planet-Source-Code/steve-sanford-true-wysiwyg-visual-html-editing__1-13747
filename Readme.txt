-DESCRIPTION:
Visual X Page is FREEware WYSIWYG HTML Editor. It has many features
of costly software, but is compact and freeware.
NOTE: Its nowhere near being finnished! It has a basic core and UI.
Excellent starting point for a real good editor though.

Its based on Microsoft's dHTML SDK. I included the SDK's help file.
To get the code to work correctly, you're going to have to install
the Visual X Page software. It uses several DLLs and ActiveX controls.


-SOURCE CODE
Visual X Page IS open source. The newest copy of the the official
source code can be grabbed from RamPage Software's homepage:
